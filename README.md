Ideas
---------
Cookbook - Could input ingredients in your home and return recipes you can make.
         - Add feature to cooking app- Also could make recipes from your shopping list.

Food Wastage reduction through donation - App that connects restaurants or events with charity homes and needy households for food donations.

Crime reports - put in a city or town and get a list of reported crime from the police department website and possibly any news articles
                that relate to it

Study App- includes flashcards, upload notes, highlight option etc.

Pomodoro Timer App - Allows the user to change the time, write notes off what distracts them during their session, track their sessions data, friendly/clean UI

**(We could add the Pomodoro Timer as an additional feature (see the readme). Other apps donâ€™t have this. We could somehow award points or just keep track and show how long a user has been productive. Besides, you could argue Quizlet and Evernote also offer a simple and cheap way to study too so we need to come up with new feature ideas anyways.)** - Nil
