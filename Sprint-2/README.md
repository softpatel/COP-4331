# Sprint 2 #

## Vision Statement ##
The product that our team strive to create is a study aid web app that students and anyone looking to study can use to study in a productive and efficient way. It will include features such as the ability to upload personal notes and mark and highlight selected texts, the ability to create flashcards, and use of a Pomodoro Timer, which other apps, such as Quizlet and Evernote, don’t have. This app will remove the need to buy studying supplies and allow quick and easy access to users’ notes, which will help people learn material faster, and increases productivity. Our study aid app will offer a simple and cheap way to study.
